I chose to do a simple shooting game (on the theme of Halloween) that is commonly played. The player has to use the left and right key to control the shooting candy to shoot the pumpkins.
It makes use of the emitter function we learnt in class. I set up two emitters – one for pumpkins and another for candy (dots) that start to emit when the game begins. I also applied my knowledge in moving objects in this game. 
I sought to make the pumpkin disappear after a candy hits it. One useful code that saved me a lot of time is the distance function that I used to calculate the distance between the dot and the pumpkin. 
I learnt that I could use key codes to control the key movements and this has a lot of potential. I incorporated the code I found online into my game. I used the keys to move the shooter left and right.
I also set difficulty buttons by styling them in html, which changed the rate of the pumpkins. Initially I had the conception that I could change the rate of the pumpkins by calling on the draw interval more frequently. However, after consulting the Prof, a much simpler way was to create a variable to represent the rate and then change its value in the difficulty functions.
I stumbled along the way while doing this project. Using console.log functions helped me to keep track of what was working and what was not. It was especially frustrating to get errors that I did not know how to resolve. Sometimes it was carelessness (forgetting ‘;’ or a ‘)’) sometimes it was bigger issues like not defining a function or using the wrong attributes for rectangle. 
I used several interval timers to keep track of the emitter that emits pumpkins and dots as well as the draw function that moves the pumpkins and dots. They were reset at the end of the game.
To ‘hide’ the pumpkins when it has been hit and after the game ends, I moved all the objects off-screen. I also cleared the intervals to reset the game.
I learnt a lot from consulting the Prof as he makes coding seem easy! When faced with errors, it is important to check the code step by step by using the debugger and think in small steps to achieve an end result.
